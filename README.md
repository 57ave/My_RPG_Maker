Everything detailled on our Wiki : https://github.com/EpitechPromo2028/B-MUL-200-PAR-2-1-myrpg-gustave.delecroix/wiki

## Getting Started
In order to start you'll need to compile with make

Now that you compile it's a whole new world oppening to you, create whatever you want. Our configuration file in ./config is an exemple but if you've read the doc you know what to do !!!
